## **Storage, Memory and the Stack** 
1. **Storage** : Every account (wallet accounts and smart contract accounts) has a persistent key-value store mapping 256-bit words to 256-bit words called storage.
    * Comparatively costly to read, and even more to initialise and modify storage
    * We should minimize what you store in persistent storage to what the contract needs to run. Store data like derived calculations, caching, and aggregates outside of the contract
    * Every state variable has a separate storage address
    * State variables are stored in Storage :

    * Analyzing storage when a contract is deployed (the After hex is Hello world)(https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x3e67b84ed9ae200a755f62f5150a039910c4509b4b3713b800cafc5f85ba3489)
        ![](assets/2023-07-31-13-10-13.png)
    * Storage when we call setText and change value: (https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0xbe56755b2872b442c0c18b3605d23169654efd73da4aacaba61d6dad435f4d40)
        ![](assets/2023-07-31-13-13-10.png)
    * When we set a larger value for text, its broken down into multiple smaller addresses,
        * Maximum space in one storage address in 256 bits ie 32 bytes ie 32 characters usually 
        *  but they're not sequential (linked by one byte at the end): (https://sepolia.etherscan.io/tx/0x961ef26bb3449d085fa89bb314db9820400ad4de6d2a380bf7a7a1f8908e4808)

            text2 = "Hello World2";
        }

    Here, we can see multiple addresses for multiple variables

2. Memory : A Smart contract obtains a freshly cleared memory for each message call - its ephemeral, fresh memory for every call
    * Memory is linear and can be addressed at byte level, but reads are limited to a width of 256 bits, while writes can be either 8 bits or 256 bits wide.
    * 
    ```
    /// for value types, the type can be only be in memory, hence it doesn't have to be specified
    function newValue() public view returns(uint256) {
       uint256 valueReturn = value1;
       valueReturn = 10;
       return valueReturn;
    }

    /// for reference types like string, the type can be in memory, in storage or in calldata, so it has to be specified
    /// valueReturn is  a pointer - returns reference to location in memory

    function newValue() public view returns(string memory) { //memory has to be specified for string
       string memory valueReturn = value4; //memory has to be specified for string
       valueReturn = 'Hello World';
       return valueReturn;
    }

    /// newText resides in memory
    function setText(string memory newText) public payable{
       
        string memory valueReturn = value4; // variable stored in memory

        text = newText;
    }
    ```
3. Calldata : It is where arguments passed to functions are temporarily stored. 
    * It is not a place where we can create variables, because it is unique to function arguments. 
    * It is also not possible to change the values of calldata: it is read-only.
    * Using calldata instead of memory saves a bit of gas 
        ```
        function setText(string calldata newText) public payable{
            text = newText;
        }
        ``` 
    * We can also return from calldata - provided the variable is already in calldata ie was received as a calldata parameter
        ```
        function getText(string calldata newText) public view returns(string calldata) { //memory has to be specified for string
           return newText;
        }
        ```
    * Takeaway : Whenever we need to pass static data to a function as an argument- use calldata
    #TODO - compare gas of calldata,memory arguments 
3. Stack  : The EVM  stack machine, so all computations are performed on a data area called the stack. 
   * It has a maximum size of 1024 elements and contains words of 256 bits. 
   * Access to the stack is limited to the top end in the following way: 
   * It is possible to copy one of the topmost 16 elements to the top of the stack or swap the topmost element with one of the 16 elements below it. 
   * All other operations take the topmost two (or one, or more, depending on the operation) elements from the stack and push the result onto the stack. 
   * Of course it is possible to move stack elements to storage or memory in order to get deeper access to the stack, but it is not possible to just access arbitrary elements deeper in the stack without first removing the top of the stack.
#Todo - cover types, bytes, string as array
