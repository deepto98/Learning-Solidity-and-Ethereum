# Class 2 - Solidity Basics

## Contracts 
Contracts are similar to classes in object-oriented languages. They contain persistent data in state variables, and functions that can modify these variables.

* Contracts can be created in Solidity in IDEs like Remix or in JS using web3.js

## Constructor
* Constructor (optional) : When a contract is created, its constructor (a function declared with the constructor keyword) is executed once.
    ```
    contract HelloWorld {
        string private text; 
        constructor() {
            text = "Hello World";
        }
    }

    ```
* After the constructor has executed, the final code of the contract is stored on the blockchain. This code:
  * Includes - All public and external functions and all functions that are reachable from there through function calls.
  * Does not include - Constructor code or internal functions only called from the constructor


## State Variables

State variables are variables whose values are permanently stored in contract storage.
```
contract SimpleStorage {
    uint storedData; // State variable
}
```
### State Visibility  

| Visibility Type   |private|  internal |  public |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|------:|
| Can be accessed from |  same contract | same contract, derived contracts | same contract, derived contracts, external contracts |

Default visibility if not explicitly defined : internal
#TODO : add examples of code

## Functions 

Can be defined both inside and outside of contracts

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.1 <0.9.0;

contract SimpleAuction {
    function bid() public payable { // Function
        // ...
    }
}

// Helper function defined outside of a contract
function helper(uint x) pure returns (uint) {
    return x * 2;
}
```
### Function Visibility

| Visibility Type   |private|  internal |  public | external |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Can be accessed from |  same contract | same contract, derived contracts |can be either called internally or via message calls | can be called from other contracts and via transactions, not internally |
| Part of ABI(Application Binary Interface)|no|no|yes|yes|

Note on Visibility : Making something private or internal only prevents other contracts from reading or modifying the information, but it will still be visible to the whole world outside of the blockchain.

#TODO : Add code examples

### Getter Functions
The compiler automatically creates getter functions (a function with the same name as the state variable) for all public state variables. e.g: 

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.9.0;

contract C {
    uint public data = 42;
}

contract Caller {
    C c = new C();
    function f() public view returns (uint) {
        return c.data();
    }
}
```
The getter functions have external visibility. If the symbol is accessed internally (i.e. without this.), it evaluates to a state variable. If it is accessed externally (i.e. with this.), it evaluates to a function.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.9.0;

contract C {
    uint public data;
    function x() public returns (uint) {
        data = 3; // internal access
        return this.data(); // external access
    }
}
```

### State Mutability

State can be modified by:
1. Writing to state variables.
2. Emitting events.
3. Creating other contracts.
4. Using selfdestruct. 
5. Sending Ether via calls.
6. Calling any function not marked view or pure.
7. Using low-level calls.
8. Using inline assembly that contains certain opcodes.

State can be read by :
1. Reading from state variables.
2. Accessing address(this).balance or <address>.balance.
3. Accessing any of the members of block, tx, msg (with the exception of msg.sig and msg.data).
4. Calling any function not marked pure.
5. Using inline assembly that contains certain opcodes.

## Types of state mutability for functions:
[Reference : https://medium.com/coinmonks/function-state-mutability-in-solidity-acb850eedccc]
1. View : These functions promise not to modify the state of the blockchain, but can read the state  
    ```
    pragma solidity 0.8.10;
    contract A {
      // Declaring state variables
      uint num1 = 5;
      uint num2 = 10;
    
      // View function to calculate product of 2 numbers
      function viewResult() public view returns(uint product){
      // Expression that reads state
         product = num1 * num2;
         return product;
      }
    }
    ```

2. Pure : they promise not to read from or modify the state.They also can't read state vars from outside the function In particular, it should be possible to evaluate a pure function at compile-time given only its inputs and msg.data, but without any knowledge of the current blockchain state. e.g: 
    ```
    pragma solidity 0.8.10;
    contract B {
      // Pure function that calculates sum of 2 numbers
      function addNum(uint num1, uint num2) public pure
      returns(uint sum){
      // Expression that computes data passed in as parameters
      // and does not read or modify state
        sum = num1 + num2;
        return sum;
      }
    }
    ```
3. Payable : Allows the function to send and receive ether. Attempting to send or receive ether through a function that is not marked as payable will result in a rejected transaction. eg:
    ```
    pragma solidity 0.8.10;
    contract C {
      uint balance = 0;
    // Payable function that allows other contracts
    // to send ether to this contract.
       function deposit () payable public{
        balance += msg.value;
      } 
    }
    ```
 `msg.value` : msg.value is a member of the msg (message) object when sending (state transitioning) transactions on the Ethereum network.
4. Non-Payable (not a keyword): It is the default state mutability modifier for functions. Non-payable functions not explicitly defined as view or pure are best suited for functions that potentially read and modify state variables. e.g:
    ```
    pragma solidity 0.8.10;
    contract D {
      uint count = 0;
    // non-payable function that reads and modifies state.
    function increment() public returns(uint){
        count += 1;
        return count;  
    }
    }
    ```
