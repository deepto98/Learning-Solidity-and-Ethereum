# Class 2 - Solidity Basics

## Contracts 
Contracts are similar to classes in object-oriented languages. They contain persistent data in state variables, and functions that can modify these variables.

* Contracts can be created in Solidity in IDEs like Remix or in JS using web3.js
* Constructor (optional) : When a contract is created, its constructor (a function declared with the constructor keyword) is executed once.
* After the constructor has executed, the final code of the contract is stored on the blockchain. This code:
  * Includes - All public and external functions and all functions that are reachable from there through function calls.
  * Does not include - Constructor code or internal functions only called from the constructor


## State Variables

State variables are variables whose values are permanently stored in contract storage.
```
contract SimpleStorage {
    uint storedData; // State variable
}
```
### State Visibility  

| Visibility Type   |private|  internal |  public |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|------:|
| Can be accessed from |  same contract | same contract, derived contracts | same contract, derived contracts, external contracts |

Default visibility if not explicitly defined : internal
#TODO : add examples of code

## Functions 

Can be defined both inside and outside of contracts

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.7.1 <0.9.0;

contract SimpleAuction {
    function bid() public payable { // Function
        // ...
    }
}

// Helper function defined outside of a contract
function helper(uint x) pure returns (uint) {
    return x * 2;
}
```
### Function Visibility

| Visibility Type   |private|  internal |  public | external |
|----------|:-------------:|------:|------:|------:|
| Can be accessed from |  same contract | same contract, derived contracts |can be either called internally or via message calls | can be called from other contracts and via transactions, not internally |
| Part of ABI(Application Binary Interface)|no|no|yes|yes|

Note on Visibility : Making something private or internal only prevents other contracts from reading or modifying the information, but it will still be visible to the whole world outside of the blockchain.

#TODO : Add code examples

### Getter Functions
The compiler automatically creates getter functions (a function with the same name as the state variable) for all public state variables. e.g: 

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.4.16 <0.9.0;

contract C {
    uint public data = 42;
}

contract Caller {
    C c = new C();
    function f() public view returns (uint) {
        return c.data();
    }
}
```
The getter functions have external visibility. If the symbol is accessed internally (i.e. without this.), it evaluates to a state variable. If it is accessed externally (i.e. with this.), it evaluates to a function.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0
pragma solidity >=0.4.0 <0.9.0;

contract C {
    uint public data;
    function x() public returns (uint) {
        data = 3; // internal access
        return this.data(); // external access
    }
}
```
